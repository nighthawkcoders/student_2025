<h style="color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:30px">What college is like for CS students:</h>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">In college, teaching assistants (TAs) focus heavily on ensuring students understand their work. They often ask students to explain their code in detail, sometimes line by line, to evaluate comprehension. Professors also play a key role by identifying and targeting areas where students need improvement, similar to live code reviews in CSP. Clear communication is essential, particularly in scenarios like interviews or events where you interact with recruiters. Being concise and direct about your achievements, projects, and goals helps make a strong impression and helps ensure that the listener takes you seriously. </p>

<h style="color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:30px">Why Joining Clubs in College is Important:</h>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">Joining college clubs and organizations often involves interviews, where questions like "Tell me about yourself" are common. Clear communication and incorporating methodologies like Agile can improve teamwork and results. Clubs are also a great way to build relationships, which can lead to valuable referrals for internships or jobs. When applying to colleges or clubs, demonstrating genuine passion for a specific field or aspect of the university is key. Additionally, taking community college classes can be highly beneficial since they offer transferable credits and can make future courses easier. While GPA matters less, hands-on experience with projects, competitions, and internships is crucial for success in college and beyond.</p>

<h style="color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:30px">How CSP skills apply to the real world:</h>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">Internships in computer science require skills like GitHub experience, which is highly valued. Passion for your field should drive your choices, as quality matters more than quantity. It's helpful to start college applications early, complete essays ahead of deadlines, and tailor portfolios to showcase your skills. Portfolios and one-page resumes are vital tools for applying to internships, especially at smaller start-ups. Career fairs and platforms like LinkedIn are excellent for finding recruiters, internships, and building professional connections. Ultimately, project-based experience, networking, and passion will open doors to opportunities in both college and your future career.</p>

<h style="color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:30px">Reflection:</h>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">Overall, this student panel was really helpful to me as the students shared some snippets of their college lives. If I do choose to pursue a major in CS, I'll know that a lot of the things that I do in this class are actually really similar to the experience of some college students in CS classes. Beyond just CS related topics, I also learned that making connections in college is important which you can form through clubs and Career Fairs. One student even mentioned that at Columbia University, they have a very connected, uplifting community where people strive to help each other. Another student mentioned how because his friends had already graduated and now work at a company, he could get recommended by them to the company which helps his job application process a lot.</p>
