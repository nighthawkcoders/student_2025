        <p style="color: rgb(250, 177, 188); font-size: 20px">
            My name is Zoe He. I'm a junior at Del Norte High School and my family is from China. I have a dog, a cat, and 3 parrots at home. One of my main hobbies is playing sports and I mainly play tennis and badminton. I like to read, cook/bake, and sketch in my free time.
