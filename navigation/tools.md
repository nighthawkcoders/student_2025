    <p style="color: white; font-family:serif; font-size:25px" class="strong">Something that I learned during the setup process was about Github. After we recovered everything we deleted using the rm -rf command, we had to post images showing proof of our progress. I didn't know what the directions meant when it said to post an issue on Github until another student explained it to me and helped me set one up. I think this information will be really useful in the future</p>

    <p style="color: white; font-family:ser; font-size:25px" class="strong">A problem I encountered was with the 'make' command was 'Error 1'. Before this, I wasn't experiencing any type of problem with the VScode and I was really confused as to why it suddenly stopped working. However, after getting help from my group member, we realized that it was only because of a simple syntax error in the _config.yml file, where I accidentally added a space in front one of the lines. This made me more cautious about needing to correctly write code because one misspelled word or an accidental space could mean the difference between everything. Another problem I encountered was when I had accidentally deleted a huge portion of code from the index.html file. Because of this, I kept getting a blank page. Eventually, I realized my mistakes and recovered the deleted code.</p>
