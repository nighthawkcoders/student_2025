    <p style="color: white; font-family:serif; font-size:25px" class="strong">One of the first tools I downloaded was Ubuntu, which is what allows me to write code and generate a webpage. I would use the 'make' command to run a local server and test the changes I made.Additionally, I also downloaded ruby, python, and jupyter.</p>
    <p style="color: white; font-family:ser; font-size:25px" class="strong">A problem I encountered with the 'make' command was 'Error 1'. Before this, I wasn't experiencing any type of problem with the VScode and I was really confused as to why it suddenly stopped working. However, after getting help from my group member, we realized that it was only because of a simple syntax error, where I accidentally added a space in front one of the lines. This made me more cautious about needing to correctly write code because one misspelled word or an accidental space could mean the difference between everything.</p>
