# Reflecting on My MCQ Performance: Strengths and Ways to Improve

Hi, I’m Yash, and recently in CSP I took a multiple-choice quiz on programming and computer science. It covered a lot of different topics, and I learned a lot about what I’m good at and what I need to work on. Here’s a quick summary of how it went and what I can do to improve.

## What I Did Well

I was happy to see that I did really well in some areas:
- **Data Abstraction (100%)**: I’m good at simplifying complex problems by breaking them into smaller parts.
- **Developing Procedures (100%)**: I feel confident designing reusable blocks of code, which helps make programs more organized.
- **Libraries and Crowdsourcing (100%)**: I understand how to use external resources and collaborate to solve problems.

I also did well in tasks that require organizing my code, like **developing programs with abstractions (78%)**, which shows I have a solid foundation.

## What I Need to Improve

The quiz also showed me where I need to focus more:
- **Conditionals and Boolean Expressions (33%-50%)**: I struggled with creating and understanding logical conditions in programs.
- **Using Programs with Data (43%)**: Working with data, like extracting or organizing it, was tough for me.
- **Developing Algorithms (36%)**: This was my weakest area. I need more practice building efficient solutions to problems.

## How I’ll Improve

Here’s my plan to get better:
1. **Practice Weak Areas**: I’ll practice conditionals, data handling, and algorithms using online coding platforms like LeetCode or Khan Academy.
2. **Build Small Projects**: I’ll create projects that involve working with data and writing algorithms to apply what I’ve learned.
3. **Review Regularly**: I’ll go over tricky topics every week to make sure I really understand them.
4. **Debugging Practice**: I’ll use debugging tools to track errors in my code, especially for logical conditions.

## Final Thoughts

This quiz was a great way to see what I know and where I need to improve. Even though some parts were hard, I’m excited to keep learning and getting better. With more practice, I know I can turn my weak spots into strengths.
