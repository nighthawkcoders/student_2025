# Yash Patil's Journey

## About Me
Hello! I’m Yash Patil, a sophomore at Del Norte High School, passionate about business and technology. My goal is to create innovative solutions that help small businesses and drive social impact.

## My Learning Journey

### Setting Up My GitHub Pages Blog

As part of my learning journey, I followed the setup process for creating my own blogging website on GitHub Pages. Here’s an overview of the steps I took:

1. **Linux Terminal and Shell Commands**:  
   - Used commands like `ls`, `pwd`, and `cd` to navigate and manage folders.
   - Learned how to run version control commands like `git clone` to set up a local project.

2. **Version Control with Git**:
   - Mastered essential commands such as `git pull`, `git commit`, and `git push` to update, save, and sync changes with my GitHub repository.

3. **Package Management**:
   - Installed key tools and frameworks using `apt-get` on Linux and `brew` on macOS, ensuring my development environment was properly set up.

4. **Starting the Project**:
   - Created a directory for my project and cloned the repository.
   - Activated a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies.
   - Built a local server using the `make` command to test my changes before deploying them.

5. **VSCode Workflow**:
   - Opened my project in VSCode and used the built-in source control tools to stage, commit, and sync changes with GitHub.
   - Ensured my GitHub Pages site automatically updated with the latest changes.

## Achievements
- **GoLocal Web Business**: Co-founded a business to help local businesses with web design and CRM solutions.
- **Needz4Teens**: Created an initiative to support teens in shelters by providing essential resources.

## Interests
In addition to tech, I love playing soccer and following Liverpool FC. Soccer has taught me teamwork and perseverance, which I apply in my projects.
