<h>5 Things I Did:</h>
- 1- Burn Down List
- On our team Kanban board, we each added burndown lists and stories that we worked to completing as we progressed through out website.

- 2- Made inital foundation for the style pages

<img id="style commits" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/styleaction.png" width=450px height=250px>
</center>
- When we first decided to make some style changes to our page, I made the initial foundation for the style pages by adding an HTML element in restaurant_frontend on Asia and then repeated the process for most of the home pages for each continent by changing the colors. Some of changes were then made by other team members who polished the look and added on more images and buttons. 
- 3- Maps - Asia

- Because our website revolves around places from all around the world, we decided to add maps that gave the location of popular restaurants as a feature to our website. I added a few maps of restaurants that were popular mainly in Asia from embeding the HTML code. This way, when users interact with our website, they can scroll and click on the maps from our pages and easily locate the restaurant they want to visit.
- 4. Issues
<img id="style code" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/issues.png">
- Throughout the 12 weeks, I took a number of notes on issues following every Tech Talk and and every class meeting. However, the most important issue that highlights my participation in this class is the notes I took on the Issue from the Girls in CS Meeting after school as it really opened my eyes to the opportunities that computer science has and gained a lot of knowledge and insight to what college life is like.
- 5- Internet Road Map
- When creating this road map, Sanya and I both worked together to create a map that would show how websites were connected via an "Internet Road." Initially, I created a diagram based on my knowledge from the College Board videos, but we were advised to expand on the metaphor of a highway. As Sanya created a diagram of a road, I decided to make a Internet Road Map, that showcased all of the stops that the car (user) would have to take to get to our website.
- Additionally, this project introduced me to CPT Big Idea 4, about the Internet and how HTTP methods interacted with backend.

<h>Project Feature:</h>
Location tables 
<img id="tables code" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/tablecode.png">
<img id="tables action" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/tableaction.png">
<img id="frontend table" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/tablefront.png">
- One thing we also added was tables that connected to backend and displayed the location of restaurants in tables. In order to connect frontend to backend, I had to make sure that the backend was able to send the data to the frontend that required using the GET method, which requested data from the API in the backend. 
- I also used Postman to test out whether or not the API would work or not and when it displayed the information back to me in JSON format, it meant that it worked.
- To make sure that the table would update and show in the frontend, this code fetches the data from the backend so when backend is active, the table in the frontend will use the GET method to retrieve the data expected to be in JSON format. This way, whenever a new restaurant is added in the backend, it will be displayed on a table in the frontend.
- By doing this feature, it allowed me to hit CPT requirements  1.4 (Debugging Code and Fixing Errors) and 2 (Data) as I learned how to use Postman to execute tests and be able to retrive data from the backend and make it display on the frontend.

<h>Night @ The Museum Feedback:</h>
- As I was at the DECA Conference, I was unable to attend the Night @ The Museum event. However, I did receive feedback from people who around the area during the 5pm make up session. After presenting our website to a group of people, they said that they thought the recipes generator was a great idea and would be something that they would use as a convenient tool and that they liked the style of the buttons and different colors for each of the pages. I also noticed that the comments off of our N@M issues stated the same thing in that people found our style appealing but also thought that our website could have more user interactions.

- However, something that they thought could be improved was the Reviews pages. They suggested that we make the font a little bigger, as it was difficult for them to read from far away. They also suggested that we add more pictures to the page to make it more visually appealing.
- I also watched another CSP student's website, which was focused on being a calendar planning website that allowed you to add users and make more complex actions. In the future, maybe we could also implement a feature that saves a user's history when they perhaps mark something down on a calendar and fit it into the context of our website.

<h>Multiple Choice Reflection:</h>
- Overall Score: 41/67
- Topics I struggled on: 1.B (Determine and design an appropriate method or approach to achieve the purpose), 3.B (Use abstraction to manage complexity in a program), 4.B (Determine the result of code segments), 4.C ( Identify and correct errors in algorithms and programs, including error discovery through testing)
- Compared to my last score of 29/67, I would say that I was generally able to improve my score and especially discovered a better understanding of some of the code segments. However, I would say that the questions with code segments and roman numerals were still my weakest point and often difficult for me to understand and I would like to get more practice with those types of questions. Most if not all of the questions that I missed included flowcharts, simulations, roman numerals, code segments, or algorithms that were difficult for me to visualize and understand in terms of coding.

<img id="corrections" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/corrections.png">

- In order to improve my score on the real exam, I plan to continue watching Khan Academy tutorials and watchign College Board videos, specifically the videos that go over the topics that I missed on both the first MCQ as well as on this MCQ. I will also go over the reflection blog for the last MCQ we did and go over the topics and questions that I struggled with and redo them to get familar with the concepts that I am missing. 
<h>Self Assessment:</h>
- Overall, I think I deserve an 8/10 because I could have reached out and asked for more help when I needed, but I still made great efforts to try and learn. I noticed that within these 12 weeks, I really struggled in being able to keep up with the pace of the class and often found myself behind on the assignments and in my group. Another thing I struggled on was being unable to understand how to do a lot of things and was unable to ask for help in many cases where I could solve problems I was facing which is something I'm actively working on outside of APCSP as well. Some examples of this would be asking students who were more involved in CS and going to CS tutoring meetings during office hours and lunch. However, I really believe that I was actually able to gain some understanding of how the internet works and learn how to frontend and backend are connected, how data is retrieved and what GET, POST, and PULL do, and how to use APIs and how to use them to get data from other website which helped me expand my knowledge with computer science from trimester 1 to know. Overall, I think that although I was slow to pick up many of the concepts in class, I was able to learn a lot and I'm proud of the progress I made.
- In the future, because I plan to pursue psychology in college, I think that some of the concepts I learned in CSP will definitely be helpful. For example, something that I'm doing now is working with a college student who works at the UCSD laboratory and I realized that a lot of it is related to being able to use a computer to organize data, store files, run simulations and more, even if it's not specifically in VSCode. I think that as I work more with him in the future, I will be able to apply some of the concepts I learned in CSP to my work.
