<h style="color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:30px">Topics I know: </h>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">1.3, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.5, 3.13, 5.2, and 5.5</p>
<h style="color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:30px">Topics I need to review:</h>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px"> 1.4, 3.6, 3.8, 3.9, 3.15, 3.17, 4.2, and 5.1</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:15px">Overall, I noticed that I struggled a lot with topics 1.4 (identifying and correcting errors), 2.1 (binary numbers), 3.3 (mathematical expressions), 3.6-3.8(conditionals and iterations), 3.9 (developing algorithms), 3.15 (random values), 3.17 (algorithm efficiency), 4.2, (fault tolerance)and 5.1 (beneficial and harmful effects). I feel like I'm struggling more on the topic 4.C though because I was really confused whenever an image of a diagram showed up. This makes sense because looking at my times on each question, I usually spent over 3 minutes any time the question asked about a program, an algorithm, a simulation, or just showed a code segment. To get better at these topics, I plan to watch and take notes from the daily videos that discuss these topics. On the topics that I would say relates more to the process of coding (3.6, 3.8, 3.9, etc.), I will go back to some of the lessons from Sprint 2 that go over these topics and/or watch the daily videos when I get confused. I feel like I did better with real world application questions though, as I got higher percentages on topics such as 5.1 (legal and ethical concerns) or 5.2 (digital divide), since I didn't get as many of these question types wrong. I think the main takeaway from this MCQ for me is that I need to get a better understanding of how to correct and construct code and I need to learn more about how computer science is applied to the real world. However, I need to improve on my MCQ skills overall because I struggled a little bit everywhere.</p>
<h style="color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:30px">MCQ Summary/Corrections:</h>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">1 → Swap values of first and second 4.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px"> The code segment never changes the value of second. It should be B because the code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of first, which has been stored in temp, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the initial values of first and second have been interchanged.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">5 → Movie theater ticket prices based on age 5.A</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">This code segment will set One word, ticket Price to 17 for all purchasers between the ages of 12 and 60, regardless of whether or not the movie is 3-D. It should be C because this code segment initially sets One word, ticket Price to 12, and then changes the price to 9 only for children and seniors. The code segment then increases One word, ticket Price by 5 for 3-D movies.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">11 → Simulate spinner with three unequal sections 2.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">It shouldn't be 30.6 because it would be a better estimate for year 11. It should be 31.2 because the total number of registered users appears to be increasing by about 0.5 million each year, so in year 12, the number of users can be approximated at 31.2 million using the equation 30.2 + 0.5 + 0.5.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">12 → Social media 12 year projections 5.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px"> A and B do not display the same values,instead display different values</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">14 → Comparing loop algorithms 1.D</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">The date an e-book was published is an example of descriptive metadata, so it would actually help support the search feature</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">19 → Library e-books metadata 5.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">Metadata for an e-book would typically be used to provide descriptive information about the book. Previous versions of the e-book would likely be considered data, not metadata. However, the date an e-book was published is an example of descriptive metadata that would help support the search</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">21 → Comparing robot algorithms 3.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">A is not the right answer because the code segment moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it right one time so that the robot faces the bottom of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">22 → Procedure to determine the weather 2.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">This option is incorrect. This Boolean expression evaluates to true when counter (the number of temperatures greater than or equal to 90) is less than 50% of total (the number of entries in the list).</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">23 → Redundant routing with 4 computers 1.D</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">This option is incorrect. There are multiple paths from P to S (for example, P to R to S, P to Q to S, P to R to Q to S, and P to Q to R to S). It should be B because redundant routing is impossible if there is only one possible path from one device to another. There is only one possible path from P to S (P to R to Q to S).</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">24 → Compression by replacing TH and IS with characters 1.D</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">Whether a transformation is lossy or lossless is not related to whether or not it can be used in secure communications.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">26 → Completing robot code by adding if statement 2.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">D is wrong because this code segment moves the robot one square forward from its initial location and then rotates the robot right. From there, the robot cannot move forward and the body of the IF statement is never executed again.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">28 → Text-editing application with binary sequences 3.C</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">This option is incorrect. Using 4 bits will only allow for up to 16 characters open parenthesis, 2 raised to the fourth power equals 16, close parenthesis</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">29 → Diagram with three logic gates 2.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">D is wrong. With these inputs, the AND gate will produce an output of false and the first OR gate will produce an output of true. The second OR gate will have one false input and one true input, causing the circuit to have an output of true.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">30 → Video-streaming service by genre 1.D</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px"></p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">34 → Mouse and predator simulations 1.D</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">The number of mice changes each day as determined by the One word, Next Day Population procedure, so A is not right. It should be D because the number of predators is initialized at the beginning of the program but is never updated.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">36 → Result of computer performing 2 divided by 3 1.D</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">Overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a certain number of bits.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">37 → Comparing code segments to compute average from list 1.D</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">D is incorrect. Both code segments display the correct average. Code segment I requires more arithmetic operations because it performs the operation sum divided by LENGTH, open parenthesis, num List, close parenthesis within the loop, while code segment II performs the same operation
only once.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">38 → Frequent customers of a snack bar 4.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">A is wrong because the expression count divided by 10 equals 0 does not evaluate to true when count is a multiple of 1 0, so this
code segment does not set cost to 0 appropriately.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">39 → Internet open standards and protocols 5.A</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">Open standards and protocols cannot be used to allow copyrighted materials to be shared freely.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">41 → Computer science midterm and final with MAX 2.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">This expression replaces the final exam score (rather than the midterm exam score) with the higher of the two scores. It should be B because the expression uses theMax procedure to replace the midterm score with the higher of the two scores. The selected value is then added to the final exam score and assigned to One word, adjusted Total.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">42 → Increasing bit representation for internet protocol 3.C</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">C is incorrect. IPv6 has 2 raised to the ninety sixth power times as many possible addresses as IPv4.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">43 → Runtime of algorithm for online retailer 1.D</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">The number of steps of the algorithm is a polynomial, so the algorithm runs in reasonable time. Instead, the pattern in the table appears to indicate that there are n squared steps for a list containing n items. This number of steps is a polynomial and therefore the algorithm runs in reasonable time. </p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">44 → Using a 4 bit representation for integers 1.D</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">The operation 4 plus 8 does not produce a result large enough to cause an overflow error. It should be B because it has 4 bit integer representation so 2^4 to the fourth power values can be represented, which allows for the values between 0 to 1 5, inclusive. If an operation results in a value greater than 1 5, an overflow error will occur. Of the operations given in the options, only 10 plus 7 gives a result larger than 1 5.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">46 → Infinite loops in undecideable problems 1.A</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px"></p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">47 → Encrypting and decrypting using public key cryptography 5.E</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">It is not possible to create an algorithm to solve an undecidable problem for all programs and inputs.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">48 → Science experiment with 75 percent successful trials 2.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px"></p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">49 → Completing code to display multiples of 5 2.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px"> The sender’s private key cannot be used to decrypt the message. In public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">50 → Searching list target 4.B
55 → Results of the Keep Playing procedure 4.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">C is incorrect because this option causes the experiment to be successful when RANDOM, open parenthesis 1 comma 100, close parenthesis results in exactly 7 5, or 1%
of the time.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">56 → Skip counting integers in a loop 4.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">A is wrong because the loop should iterate once for each multiple of 5 from start to end. The number of multiples of 5 from start to end is given by Open parenthesis, open parenthesis, end minus start, close parenthesis, divided by 5, close parenthesis, plus 1. For the example given, Open parenthesis, open parenthesis, end minus start, close parenthesis, divided by 5, close parenthesis, plus 1evaluates to 4.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">58 → Defining Internet enabled crowdsourcing 1.C</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px"></p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">61 → Data about students and East and West High schools 5.B</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">The procedure always returns false.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">62 → Compare online encyclopedia with paper encyclopedia 5.C</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">The answer should be D, not B, because the value of count starts at 1 and increases by twos, so it counts odd integers. The loop iterates 10
times, adding each intermediate value of count each time. Therefore, the program displays the sum of the odd integers starting at 1 and ending at 19.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">63 → Use of isPrime procedure 4.C
64 → Cloud computing and the Internet 5.C</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">D is wrong. Only statements I and II are correct. Option III is incorrect because there are some problems that cannot be solved in reasonable time.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">65 → Correcting errors in procedure Multiply 4.C</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">D isn't a correct option because West High School provides a student ID for each student, but East High School does not but A and B are correct options.</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">66 → Test cases for procedure Smallest 4.C
</p>
<p style= "color: gray; font-family: courier new; font-size:20px">B is not correct because an article may contain different content when it is accessed at different times since they can be edited by any user.</p>
