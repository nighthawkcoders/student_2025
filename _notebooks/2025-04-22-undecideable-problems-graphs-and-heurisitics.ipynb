    "1. Changing the order of the coins from [25, 10, 5, 1] to [1, 5, 10, 25] made it so that the number of coins used was increasing.\n",
    "2. The original algorithm, which started with the largest coin, used fewer coins. This is because it makes larger reductions to the amount at each step, reaching the target with fewer, larger coin denominations.\n",
    "3. Greedy algorithms work well in scenarios where local optimal choices lead to a global optimal solution. For example, they’re effective when the problem has simple, clear rules and a direct path to the optimal solution (like with coin denominations that are multiples of one another). However, they can fail when the problem involves non-optimal local choices that don't add up to the best overall solution, such as in cases with unusual or non-multiple coin denominations.\n",
    "4. I changed the order of coins from largest to smallest to smallest to largest. This showed that the greedy algorithm isn't always efficient when applied in reverse, highlighting that starting with larger coins can minimize the number of coins used, while starting with smaller ones can result in a less efficient solution.\n",
    "5. **Summary:** Changing the order of coins in the greedy algorithm increased the number of coins used by starting with the smaller denominations. The original algorithm, which used larger coins first, resulted in fewer coins. Greedy algorithms work well when local choices lead to the optimal solution, but they can fail when they don’t align with the overall optimal outcome."
