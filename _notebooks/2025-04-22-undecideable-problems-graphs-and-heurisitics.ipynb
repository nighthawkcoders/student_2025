    "- Decidable problem: decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs\n",
    "- Undecidable problem: a problem that has no algorithm that can provide a yes or no answer\n",
    "- The halting problem: a program takes an input and will either eventually stop (halt) or run forever\n",
    "- Graphs: a fundamental data structure in computer science used to model relationships between objects.\n",
    "- Adjacency Matrix: a way of representing a graph through booleans and 0s and 1s\n",
    "- Adjacency List: An array of lists stores edges between two vertices.\n",
    "- The size of an adjacency list is equal to the number of vertices/nodes\n",
    "- Heuristic: A heuristic is an approach to a problem that produces a solution that is not guaranteed to be optimal but may be used when techniques that are guaranteed to always find an optimal solution are impractical.\n",
    "-  Nearest Neighbor Heuristic: The algorithm picks the closest unvisited location at each step. Itâ€™s fast, but not always optimal.\n",
    "- Greedy Algorithms: Takes the largest value first, but is not optimal\n",
    "- Heuristic Search Strategies:  search algorithms find solutions faster by guessing which path is best to try next.\n",
