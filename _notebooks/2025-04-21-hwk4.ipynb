    "The best two ways would be number 2 and 4 because the modulus operator is the most efficient and direct way to check for evenness in constant time (O(1)). Checking the last digit is also O(1) and works well because even numbers always end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8."

    "1. Linear search has a time complexity of O(n) because it goes through each element one by one until it finds the target. This means that in the worst case, it might need to look at every single item in the list. Binary search, on the other hand, has a time complexity of O(log n). It works by dividing the list in half repeatedly, which makes it much faster for large sorted lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Binary search can be hundreds of thousands of times faster than linear search in theory. For a list of 10 million elements, linear search may do up to 10 million checks, while binary search does only about 23. In practice, Python's overhead and other factors make the actual speedup closer to 500x to 1000x. Still, binary search is dramatically more efficient on large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you make the data size  20 million, linear search will take about twice as long to complete. This is because it still has to scan through most or all of the list. Binary search will only be slightly slower since it adds just one more step to divide the list further. The performance gap between them grows even wider as the dataset increases."

    "Merge Sort is more efficient because it breaks the list into smaller pieces and sorts them using divide-and-conquer, which reduces the number of comparisons. Bubble Sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements, leading to many unnecessary operations, especially in large lists. As a result, Merge Sort has a better time complexity and scales much better than Bubble Sort."
