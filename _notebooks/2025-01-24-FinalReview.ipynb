    "# AP CSP Exam Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Progress and Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "In my latest AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) practice exam, I scored **44/67**, which is an improvement from my previous **40/67**. While this is a step forward, there's still room for growth, particularly in specific skill areas where I struggled.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the skill breakdown, I performed well in:\n",
    "- **Investigating Situations and Context (Skill 1.A) - 100%**\n",
    "- **Designing Methods for Solutions (Skill 1.B) - 100%**\n",
    "- **Collaboration in Development (Skill 6.A) - 100%**\n",
    "- **Implementing Algorithms (Skill 2.B) - 64% but still a strong area**\n",
    "- **Using Safe and Secure Methods in Computing (Skill 6.B) - 100%**\n",
    "\n",
    "These results show that I have a solid grasp of conceptual and algorithmic problem-solving, along with a strong understanding of secure computing principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Areas for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "There were some areas where I need to focus more attention:\n",
    "- **Identifying and Correcting Errors (Skill 4.C) - 14%**  \n",
    "- **Describing the Impact of a Computing Innovation (Skill 5.C) - 0%**  \n",
    "- **Describing the Impact of Gathering Data (Skill 5.D) - 50%**  \n",
    "- **Understanding Parallel and Distributed Computing (Skill 4.3) - 50%**  \n",
    "\n",
    "These scores indicate that debugging and understanding computing impacts are areas where I should spend extra time reviewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More Practice on Debugging & Error Identification**  \n",
    "   My **14%** score in identifying and correcting errors suggests I need to work on understanding common mistakes in code and how to resolve them efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strengthen Understanding of Computing Innovations & Data Collection**  \n",
    "   The **0% in Skill 5.C** means I need to read up on real-world computing innovations and their implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Continue Building on Algorithmic Thinking**  \n",
    "   My scores in implementing and applying algorithms are strong but could still be improved further.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Review Debugging Techniques** ‚Äì Practice more coding problems that require error detection.\n",
    "- **Study the Impact of Computing** ‚Äì Read case studies on real-world computing applications.\n",
    "- **Targeted Practice** ‚Äì Focus on questions related to Skill 5.C and Skill 4.C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this practice test showed an **increase in performance**, and I‚Äôm aiming to keep improving with better preparation in weaker areas.  \n",
