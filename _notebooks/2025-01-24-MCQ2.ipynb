    "# AP CSP Exam Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Progress and Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "In my latest AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) practice exam, I scored **44/67**, which is an improvement from my previous **40/67**. While this is a step forward, there's still room for growth, particularly in specific skill areas where I struggled.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the skill breakdown, I performed well in:\n",
    "- **Investigating Situations and Context (Skill 1.A) - 100%**\n",
    "- **Designing Methods for Solutions (Skill 1.B) - 100%**\n",
    "- **Collaboration in Development (Skill 6.A) - 100%**\n",
    "- **Implementing Algorithms (Skill 2.B) - 64% but still a strong area**\n",
    "- **Using Safe and Secure Methods in Computing (Skill 6.B) - 100%**\n",
    "\n",
    "These results show that I have a solid grasp of conceptual and algorithmic problem-solving, along with a strong understanding of secure computing principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Areas for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "There were some areas where I need to focus more attention:\n",
    "- **Identifying and Correcting Errors (Skill 4.C) - 14%**  \n",
    "- **Describing the Impact of a Computing Innovation (Skill 5.C) - 0%**  \n",
    "- **Describing the Impact of Gathering Data (Skill 5.D) - 50%**  \n",
    "- **Understanding Parallel and Distributed Computing (Skill 4.3) - 50%**  \n",
    "\n",
    "These scores indicate that debugging and understanding computing impacts are areas where I should spend extra time reviewing.\n",
    "## Top 5 Individual Questions To Fix\n",
    "![My Project Screenshot](./images/1.png)\n",
    "## Q22 - Simulating a Spinner\n",
    "**Wrong Answer (C):** Chose an incorrect conditional probability distribution.\n",
    "Incorrect because the given code does not match the intended ⅓, ⅓, ⅓ probability split.\n",
    "**Correct Answer:**\n",
    "Correct because the right code properly distributes the outcomes as specified in the problem statement.\n",
    "![My Project Screenshot](./images/2.png)\n",
    "Wrong Answer (D): \"IPv6 allows users to bypass older security protocols so that data can be sent peer-to-peer without the use of routers.\"\n",
    "Incorrect because IPv6 does not remove security protocols or allow users to bypass routers for direct communication.\n",
    "Correct Answer (B): \"IPv6 allows for a greater number of addresses than IPv4, which allows more devices to be connected to the Internet.\"\n",
    "Correct because IPv6's primary benefit is its vastly larger address space compared to IPv4.\n",
    "![My Project Screenshot](./images/3.png)\n",
    "Wrong Answer (D): \"Line 11\"\n",
    "Incorrect because removing Line 11 would stop the loop from correctly iterating through numbers.\n",
    "Correct Answers (A, C):\n",
    "Line 5 should be removed because the count should only be incremented inside the IF block, not before it.\n",
    "Line 9 should be removed because it causes an extra increment, leading to incorrect counting.\n",
    "![My Project Screenshot](./images/4.png)\n",
    "Wrong Answer (D): \"Program B displays one more value than Program A.\"\n",
    "Incorrect because both programs print exactly ten values.\n",
    "Correct Answer (A): \"Program A and program B display identical values in the same order.\"\n",
    "Correct because even though the initialization differs, both loops execute the same number of times with the same increments.\n",
    "\n",
    "![My Project Screenshot](./images/5.png)\n",
    "## Q41 - Secure Data Transmission\n",
    "** Wrong Answer (B):** \"Sending the data using a high-bandwidth connection.\"\n",
    " Incorrect because a faster connection does not inherently provide security.\n",
    "**Correct Answer (C):** \"Sending the data using public-key encryption.\"\n",
    " Correct because encryption ensures data security by making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More Practice on Debugging & Error Identification**  \n",
    "   My **14%** score in identifying and correcting errors suggests I need to work on understanding common mistakes in code and how to resolve them efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strengthen Understanding of Computing Innovations & Data Collection**  \n",
    "   The **0% in Skill 5.C** means I need to read up on real-world computing innovations and their implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Continue Building on Algorithmic Thinking**  \n",
    "   My scores in implementing and applying algorithms are strong but could still be improved further.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Review Debugging Techniques** – Practice more coding problems that require error detection.\n",
    "- **Study the Impact of Computing** – Read case studies on real-world computing applications.\n",
    "- **Targeted Practice** – Focus on questions related to Skill 5.C and Skill 4.C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this practice test showed an **increase in performance**, and I’m aiming to keep improving with better preparation in weaker areas.  \n",
