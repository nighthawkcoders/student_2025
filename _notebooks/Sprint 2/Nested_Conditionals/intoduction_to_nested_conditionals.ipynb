    "title: The basics of Nested Condiotionals\n",
    "description: Nested conditionals in JavaScript allow for more complex decision-making by placing one conditional statement inside another. This structure enables a program to check additional conditions only if the previous condition is true, creating a layered decision process. In this lesson, students will learn how to implement nested if, else if, and else statements to create more specific control flows in their programs. Through examples and exercises, they will gain a deeper understanding of how to manage multiple conditions effectively, enhancing the logic of their code.\n",

    "<h5><span style=\"; color:#9999ff\">To gain a better understanding about Nested Conditionals and how they work, first we need to understand what condtionals are; Conditionals in general are \"if-then\" statements. They allow your program to make decisions based on certain conditions. If the condition is true, the program will do one thing; if itâ€™s false, the program will do something else (or nothing at all). Here's an example. \n",
    "Think of it as asking a question and then deciding what to do based on the answer:\n",

    "\n",
    "    Alternative Answer/Input: \"Not that well\"\n",
    "    Alternative Result: \"Sorry to hear that, I hope it isn't that bad.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Nested Conditionals are conditionals within other conditionals. Let's use the previous example and extend it to an example with nested conditionals:\n",
