    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">A <b>boolean</b> is a data type that represents one of two possible values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Booleans are useful for decision-making in code, as they let us determine if specific conditions are met. For example, if we want to check if someone meets the age requirement for a concert or has a ticket, we might represent these conditions as booleans.</span></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">A <b>nested boolean</b> is simply a boolean condition used inside another condition. When using <b>nested conditionals</b> (conditions inside other conditions), we can build complex decision-making logic. For example, we might check first if the person is old enough, and if they are, then check if they have a ticket. This kind of logic allows us to handle multiple conditions in a structured way.</span></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">Hereâ€™s an example:</span></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let isOldEnough = true; // Boolean indicating if the person meets the age requirement\n",
    "let hasTicket = false; // Boolean indicating if the person has a ticket\n",

    "if (isOldEnough) { // Check if the person meets the age requirement\n",
    "    if (hasTicket) { // Nested condition to check if they have a ticket\n",
