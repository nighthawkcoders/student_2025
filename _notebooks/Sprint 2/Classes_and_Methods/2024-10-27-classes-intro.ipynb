    "Classes in JavaScript are special functions that provide a more convenient and syntactically cleaner way to create objects and deal with inheritance. Just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, a class can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration."

    "### Constructor\n",
    "As we know, the `constructor` method initializes the object. Ok, cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get\n",
    "As for the `get` getter method, this is used to get a specific property of the object. The line `return this.calcArea()` calls the `calcArea()` method, which calculates the area of the rectangle it returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function\n",
    "The `calcArea()` function method calculates area of the rectangle using the height and width properties, and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generator\n",
    "The `*getSides()` generator method allows you to return (or \"yield\") multiple values lazily, meaning they are produced one at a time, when requested, rather than all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `square.getSides()`, the generator doesn't immediately give you all four values. Instead it returns an iterator. You can then loop over this iterator, requesting one value at a time. By using the [...] spread operator (as in `console.log[...sqaure.getSides()])`), you're converting the iterator into an array containing all the yielded values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown\n",
    "We first define our class template in the `class Rectangle {}` line, with a few methods. The `constructor` method initializes the rectangle with two parameters: height and width. We then define a `get area() {}` method that returns the result of the `calcArea()` function. This `calcArea()` method multiplies the two properties of the constructed object, height and width to return the area. We have another generator function `*getSides() {}` that yields (one at a time) the values of each side length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ohhhhhkay, that was a lot. Now what about the syntax at the bottom?\n",
    "\n",
    "The line `const square = new Rectangle(10, 10);` constructs an object with width of 10 and height of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "We show getting the area by using the `area` method in `square.area` (we run a method on an object) to get 100, which goes through the entire aforementioned process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the `console.log([...square.getSides()]);` statement, this simply uses the [...] spread operator the print out the lengths of the sides as an array.\n",
