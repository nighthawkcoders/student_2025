    "# What is Data Abstraction?\n",
    "Data Abstraction is hiding the complex inner workings of code, and only exposing the part that the user/coder needs to know.\n",
    "## Real Life Examples\n",
    "Some real life examples of Data Abstraction include cars, mobile apps, games, and even the computer that you are using!!\n",
    "### Car example\n",
    "Cars are a real life example of Data Abstraction with their steering wheel. The inner electronics of the system is hidden, and only the steering wheel, and the option of moving the car left and right are shown\n",
    "### Mobile App example\n",
    "Mobile App's are another great example for Data Abstraction. One example of this is the YouTube app. Youtube hides the complex hosting features that is use, and only shows you the actual video. Another example of Data abstraction would be the messages app on your phone. It hides the complex innerworkings of how it is being sent to someone elses phone, and only shows if it is sent or not.\n",
    "### Games example\n",
    "In games such as Minecraft as Pokemon Data abstraction is a necessary, as you need to hide how multiple things are being done in order to simplify the user experience\n",
    "## Relevant examples in Javascript\n",
    "Some examples of Data abstraction in Javascript include classes, function and objects. We will go more in depth into how these are examples"
